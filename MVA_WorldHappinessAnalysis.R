#Analysis: We can see there is an inverse correlation between "Happiness Rank" and all the other numerical variables. In other words, the lower the happiness rank, the higher the happiness score, and the higher the other seven factors that contribute to happiness. So let's remove the happiness rank, and see the correlation again.

#From the scatter plot we cannot determine that combination of high economy and generosity leads to greater happiness score. 
#This is something we have to conclude after analyzing the effect of these 2 taken together.
