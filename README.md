Problem Statement:

Can a Facebook Fan Base Give a Brand The Advertising Reach It Needs?

Intro:

Facebook is the prime social media platform for most businesses to build target audiences and generate revenue.
Facebook ads are the best. They allow you to handpick your ad audience’s age, gender, location, job, and nearly any other demographic you can think of.
But the problem with Facebook ads is there’s no guideline to what’s “normal.” No one ever tells you how much you should be paying for a like or a click or what’s the average Cost Per Click for Facebook ads, because it’s different for every business and industry.
For someone just starting out, it can be confusing. 
Hence, Facebook Ad analysis can give you an inside look at Facebook ad performance.
Analysing the elements of each ad can help us understand what worked and what didn’t so we can improve our own Facebook ad performance–getting exponentially more clicks as a result.

The goals of the analysis can be:

•	Identify what the factors have the direct impact on the ad campaign and management team should focus on
•	Compare how the various ad campaigns are performing with respect to different companies
•	Quantify how conversion rate varies with age, gender or interest.
•	Identify segments with high and low cost per acquisition and how segment the audience based on click through rates conversion rates
•	Predict conversion rates for each possible age/gender/interest segment.
