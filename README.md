# Multivariate Analysis
Project Topic: World Happiness Analysis 

## Why this? Why is it important?
The pursuit of happiness had been a part of humanity longer than some may think; some even argue that it’s the reason we continue to do more than just exist. In fact, the “pursuit of happiness” was a vital part of the United States Declaration of Independence, written in 1776. If we look at the multitude of global religions, we see a similar importance placed on the idea of happiness.

## Problem Statement:
In this broad analysis, we aim to understand the different factors that contribute to the Happiness of a nation, and how these factors interact with one another. We have used the World Happiness Report as the basis for this analysis. This report features a Happiness Score for more than 150 countries based on different contributing factors like Per Capita GDP, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Trust in the Government and more. 
We will explore how the Happiness score varies across countries in different parts of the world. We will also identify the groups of countries(regions) of high happiness across the globe, and the country with highest happiness score in each region. These regions will be highlighted on a world map indicating the happiest and saddest parts of the globe.
By employing the multivariable linear regression technique (MLR), research into the underlying factors that make up the Happiness Score can possibly lead to a predictive model. This type of analysis may reduce the cost associated with data collection and could provide insight into which factors should be considered more influential in attaining an elevated Happiness Score.
## Analysis Questions:
1.	What are the different factors that lead to happiness of a country?
2.	What similarities and differences do the countries experiencing the highest/lowest WHS have?
3.	Does being in a certain region [continent] have any correlation to the average score of countries?
4.	What role does the economy play in determining the happiness of a country?
5.	Which factor, on average, contributes most/least to happiness?

## Dataset:
The dataset describes the columns in the data as follows:
1.	Country: Name of the country.
2.	Happiness Rank: Rank of the country based on the Happiness Score.
3.	Happiness Score:  Derived by totalling the 6 driving factors (Economic, Family, Health, Freedom, Generosity, Trust in Government)    and the benchmark factor (Dystopia Residual).
4.	Economy (GDP per Capita): The extent to which GDP contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score.
5.	Family: The extent to which Family contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score
6.	Health (Life Expectancy): The extent to which Life expectancy contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score
7.	Freedom: The extent to which Freedom contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score.
8.	Trust (Government Corruption): The extent to which Perception of Corruption contributes to Happiness Score.
9.	Generosity: The extent to which Generosity contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score.
10.	Dystopia Residual: The extent to which Dystopia Residual contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score.

Dystopia is an imaginary country that has the world’s least-happy people. The purpose in establishing Dystopia is to have a benchmark against which all countries can be favorably compared (no country performs more poorly than Dystopia) in terms of each of the six key variables.[Contrast to Utopia]
The Dystopia Residual metric actually is the Dystopia Happiness Score(1.85) + the Residual value or the unexplained value for each country
The residuals, or unexplained components, differ for each country, reflecting the extent to which the six variables either over- or under-explain average 2014-2016 life evaluations.
